
#Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)
num= int(input("Enter number: "))
x = range(2, num)


for elem in x:
    if num%elem == 0:
        print(elem)
